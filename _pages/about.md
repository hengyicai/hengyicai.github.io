<!-- Hengyi Cai (蔡恒毅) received his Ph.D. from [Institute of Computing Technology](http://www.ict.ac.cn){:target="_blank"}, [Chinese Academy of Sciences](https://www.ucas.ac.cn){:target="_blank"} (**Outstanding Graduate**).
He has a broad research interest related to natural languages and machine learning.
Currently, He is focusing on the research of natural language processing, especially Natural Language Generation and Efficient&Effective Text Retrieval. --> 

I am a Research Scientist at Baidu Inc., where I develop the company’s in‑house LLM infrastructure and large‑scale query understanding systems that power Baidu Search. My research spans text generation, question answering, and retrieval‑augmented language models, with publications in ACL, EMNLP, KDD, NeurIPS, and SIGIR. I earned my Ph.D. from the Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences in 2021 (Outstanding Graduate). I serve on program committees for leading conferences including ACL, EMNLP, KDD, NeurIPS, and SIGIR.

<!-- He is proud to have collaborated with [Dr. Hongshen Chen](https://www.chenhongshen.com/) from JD.com, and [Dr. Dawei Yin](http://www.yindawei.com/) from Baidu inc.. -->

<!-- **Advertisement: I am expected to graduate in Jun. 2021, and I'm now actively looking for a NLP-related position in either academia or industry.** -->
